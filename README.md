# JavaScript Object-Oriented Concepts

Welcome to this repository that explores fundamental JavaScript object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The provided code covers object creation, factory functions, constructor functions, variable assignment, object iteration, property checks, object cloning, and in-built object methods.

## Contents

1. **Object Creation:**
   - Literal notation for creating a rectangle object.
   - Factory function to create a rectangle object.
   - Factory function with parameters to create a rectangle object.

2. **Constructor Function:**
   - Example of a constructor function (`Rectangle`) to create objects.

3. **Variable Assignment and Copying:**
   - Demonstrates how primitive types and reference types are handled.

4. **Object Iteration:**
   - For...In loop for iterating through object properties.
   - For...Of loop using Object.keys() for iterating through object keys.

5. **Object Property Check:**
   - Checks if a property ('color') is present in the object.

6. **Object Cloning:**
   - Cloning an object using iteration.
   - Cloning an object using `Object.assign()` method.
   - Cloning an object using the spread operator.

7. **In-Built Object Methods:**
   - Examples of using the Math and String objects.
